Angry Professor, 
This repository contains a Python solution for the "Angry Professor" problem from HackerRank that i solved it.

Problem Description
A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, the professor decides to cancel class if fewer than some number of students are present when class starts.
Arrival times go from on time (0) to arrived late (positive values).
Given the arrival time of each student and a threshold number of attendees, determine if the class is canceled.

Input Format:

The first line contains the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:

1. The first line has two space-separated integers, the number of students and the cancellation threshold.
2. The second line contains space-separated integers describing the arrival times for each student.

Output Format:
For each test case, print "YES" if class is canceled, or "NO" otherwise.
